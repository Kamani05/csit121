    <h1>XML and JavaScript Basics</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>What is XML?</h2>
        <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) was made by the W3C to help share information on the internet in a structured way. It's like a set of rules for writing down data so that computers can easily understand and exchange it. Unlike HTML, which is mainly for showing things on a web page, XML focuses on describing and organizing data. It doesn't replace HTML but works alongside it. For example, XML developers can make their own tags to organize and explain their data, making it more flexible and powerful for different uses on the web.</p>

        <h2>How is XML used?</h2>
        <p>XML is used in a variety of applications for structured data representation and exchange. It serves as a standard format for storing and transporting information across different platforms and programming languages. In web development, XML is commonly employed to encode data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable, facilitating seamless communication between applications. It is prevalent in configuration files, as it allows for the clear definition of parameters and settings. Additionally, XML is integral to web services, where it is utilized for data interchange between different systems over the internet. Its extensibility and versatility make XML a fundamental tool for data representation and communication in a wide range of domains, from databases and document storage to configuration management and data interchange protocols.</p>

        <h2>What does XML look like? (Example)</h2>
        <p>XML consists of tags that enclose data to define its structure. Tags are typically written in angle brackets, with opening and closing tags indicating the beginning and end of an element.</p>
        <p>Here's a simple example of XML representing information about an employee:</p>
        <dl class="employee-container">
            <dt>ID</dt>
            <dd>001</dd>
            <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>Allan Smith</dd>
            <dt>Position</dt>
            <dd>Software Engineer</dd>
            <dt>Department</dt>
            <dd>Engineering</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a special language for web browsers that helps websites do cool things. It works on the part you see in your browser, making pages fun and interactive. It deals with different things on a webpage, like the whole browser window, the page itself, and specific things like forms, images, and links. Unlike regular computer languages, the browser understands and uses JavaScript right away, so it can change things on the page when you click or type. Basically, it's a tool that lets developers create websites that aren't just boring and still â€“ they can have forms that check your info, pictures that slide around, and other fun stuff that makes the website more interesting for you.</p>

        <h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are fundamental technologies for web development and collectively form the backbone of modern interactive websites. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structural framework for web pages, defining the content and layout. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) complements HTML by controlling the presentation and styling, allowing developers to manage the look and feel of a website. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive behavior within web pages. It enhances user experience by facilitating real-time updates, handling user inputs, and enabling the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically modify page content. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the core trio of technologies for building dynamic, responsive, and visually appealing web applications.</p>

        <h2>Common JavaScript Elements, Properties, Methods, and Functions</h2>
        <p>Elements in JavaScript often refer to parts of the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document.</p> 
        <p>Example let element = document.getElementById("myElement");</p>
        <p>Properties are characteristics or attributes of objects.</p>
        <p>For instance, for a JavaScript string, the length property returns the number of characters in the string: let myString = "Hello, World!";<br>let lengthOfMyString = myString.length; // Returns 13</p>
        <p>Methods are functions associated with objects.</p>
        <p>An example is the toUpperCase method for strings, which converts all characters to uppercase: let myString = "Hello, World!";<br>let upperCaseString = myString.toUpperCase(); // Returns "HELLO, WORLD!"</p>
        <p>Functions are blocks of reusable code.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers: function addNumbers(a, b) {return a + b;}<br>let result = addNumbers(5, 7); // Returns 12</p>
